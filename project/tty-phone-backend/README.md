- **Volume**: 0% to 100%

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No transcription appearing"**
- Transcriptions take 10-30 seconds to appear after they finish speaking
- Ask the other person to speak clearly and pause between sentences
- Background noise can affect transcription accuracy
- Ensure they're speaking into the phone clearly

**"Messages not being spoken clearly"**
- Check that you're hearing actual speech, not beeps
- Adjust speech rate to 0.9x for better clarity
- Try different voices in speech settings
- Ensure good internet connection

**"Call connection issues"**
- Check phone number format (include country code for international)
- Verify the number can receive calls from +15555555555
- Some carriers may block automated calls - try a different number

**"Backend connection errors"**
- Backend is deployed at: `https://tty-phone-interface.onrender.com`
- Check `/api/health` endpoint for status
- Render may take 30 seconds to wake up if idle

### Testing the System
